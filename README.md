Why this project exists
Lung cancer remains a major health challenge. Early risk assessment can help guide screening decisions and lifestyle interventions. This project demonstrates a straightforward approach to estimating lung cancer risk using logistic regression. It combines clinical symptoms, lifestyle factors, and basic demographics to produce a practical classifier. The goal is not to replace medical advice but to provide a transparent, data-driven method to support decision making in healthcare research and educational settings.

What you’ll find in the repository
- A single, comprehensive analysis notebook that contains all steps from data cleaning to evaluation. The notebook includes code cells, narrative explanations, figures, and results. It serves as the primary source of analysis and can be re-run with a fresh dataset.
- Clear documentation on the data features used. You will read about clinical symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and systemic factors like age, smoking history, occupational exposures, and other lifestyle attributes.
- Visualization outputs that help you understand data distribution, relationships between features, and model performance. Visuals include histograms, bar charts, correlation heatmaps, ROC curves, and calibration plots.
- A practical guide to feature selection, regularization choices, and model interpretation. The notebook demonstrates how to reduce feature space while preserving predictive power.
- Reproducible environment instructions, including library versions and commands to install dependencies.

How to reproduce the results
- Start by inspecting the release assets. The Releases page contains the analysis notebook and any produced figures or supplementary data. Use the link provided above to access the assets.
- Install the required software. The notebook relies on Python and standard data science libraries. A typical setup includes:
  - Python 3.8 or newer
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - jupyter
  - optional: seaborn and plotly for enhanced visuals
- Create an isolated environment to avoid conflicts. For example:
  - Using conda: conda create -n lung-cancer-prediction python=3.9
  - Then: conda activate lung-cancer-prediction
  - Or using venv: python -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate
- Install dependencies:
  - If a requirements file is provided: pip install -r requirements.txt
  - If not, install the core packages individually:
    - pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
- Run the analysis notebook:
  - Start Jupyter: jupyter notebook
  - Open the notebook file in the analysis directory and run all cells in order
- Reproducing results requires the same data and notebook. The notebook contains steps to load data, preprocess it, fit the model, and generate results. If you have a new dataset, you can adapt the notebook by adjusting the data loading cell and feature preprocessing steps.

Data description and features
- The dataset centers on predicting lung cancer risk. It blends clinical symptoms with lifestyle factors to reflect the real-world decision context for screening and diagnosis.
- Common features you will encounter include:
  - Demographic: age, sex, BMI, ethnicity (if available)
  - Smoking metrics: smoking status (current, former, never), pack-years, age at smoking initiation, cessation duration
  - Symptoms and medical history: persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, recent weight loss, fatigue
  - Exposures and risk modifiers: occupational exposure to carcinogens, air pollution, family history of cancer, prior respiratory illness
  - Lab or imaging proxies (when available): basic bloodwork indicators or imaging-based observations as features or derived features
- The notebook defines a consistent feature schema and includes feature engineering steps to transform categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for logistic regression.

Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data quality is critical for reliable predictions. The notebook implements a straightforward, transparent pipeline:
  - Handling missing values: choose simple, interpretable imputation strategies (for example, filling missing binary indicators with the mode, numeric features with median, or using a simple imputation strategy informed by domain knowledge).
  - Encoding categorical variables: convert categories to numeric codes. Use one-hot encoding only when necessary to preserve interpretability.
  - Feature scaling: standardize numeric features to ensure the logistic regression model converges smoothly and coefficients are comparable.
  - Outlier handling: assess extreme values, cap or transform outliers if needed, and document any decisions.
  - Data splitting: partition data into train and test sets with a stratified split to preserve class distribution. Consider a hold-out validation set if your dataset is large enough.
- The notebook emphasizes reproducibility and traceability. Each preprocessing step is documented with rationale and a clear code snippet. You will find the exact transformation rules and how they apply to both training and test data.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- EDA is used to build intuition and to justify modeling choices. The notebook includes:
  - Distribution checks: how common each symptom is, how lifestyle factors vary with age, and how risk correlates with smoking intensity
  - Correlation exploration: simple correlations between features and the outcome, as well as pairwise feature relationships that could inform interactions
  - Visual storytelling: charts that help stakeholders understand the data, such as:
    - Bar charts showing the prevalence of risk factors
    - Box plots for continuous features across risk groups
    - Heatmaps to examine relationships among features
  - Initial insights about potential predictive features and their clinical relevance
- The EDA step is designed to be reproducible and easy to extend with additional plots or datasets.

Feature selection strategies
- The notebook demonstrates practical feature selection for logistic regression:
  - Regularization-based selection: L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties to control model complexity and encourage sparse coefficients
  - Recursive feature elimination (RFE): iteratively removes the least important features based on model coefficients
  - Univariate screening: quick checks for features with strong individual associations with the target
  - Stability checks: across multiple train/test splits to identify features that consistently contribute to predictive performance
- The goal is to balance interpretability with accuracy. A lean feature set makes the model easier to interpret by clinicians and easier to deploy in practice.

Modeling approach
- Logistic regression serves as a transparent baseline model that yields interpretable coefficients. The notebook explores:
  - Binary outcome: cancer risk (yes/no) based on available labels
  - Regularization choices: L1 and L2 to manage multicollinearity and feature sparsity
  - Class balance handling: techniques such as class weights if the dataset is imbalanced
  - Cross-validation: to obtain robust estimates of model performance and to tune hyperparameters
  - Calibration: evaluation of probability estimates to ensure that predicted risks align with observed frequencies
- Additional commentary covers when to prefer other models (for example, tree-based models) and how logistic regression remains a strong baseline due to interpretability and stability.

Evaluation metrics and interpretation
- The notebook presents a thorough evaluation framework:
  - Discrimination metrics: ROC AUC, precision-recall AUC, accuracy, recall, precision
  - Confusion matrix: true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives
  - Threshold analysis: selecting decision thresholds that balance sensitivity and specificity according to clinical needs
  - Calibration assessment: reliability diagrams and Brier score to evaluate the quality of probability estimates
  - Feature coefficients: left-to-right interpretation of how each feature affects the log-odds of cancer
- The evaluation is designed to help readers understand model behavior in real-world scenarios, including trade-offs when adjusting thresholds.

Interpretation and clinical relevance
- The model is designed to be transparent. Coefficients map to increases or decreases in risk, making it easy to explain to clinicians.
- The notebook discusses how to present results to a healthcare audience. It emphasizes:
  - Clear explanations of what features mean in plain language
  - The limitations of a statistical model in the context of medical decision making
  - How to use predicted risk in conjunction with clinical judgment and patient preferences
- The project prioritizes responsible use. It highlights that predictions should support, not replace, medical expertise.

Reproducibility and environment
- Reproducibility is central. The notebook includes:
  - Exact library versions used for each step
  - Clear environment setup instructions
  - Instructions to reproduce figures and metrics from the same data
- If you plan to reuse this work with a different dataset, you can adapt the notebook by:
  - Replacing the data loading cell with your dataset
  - Ensuring your feature engineering steps align with the new data
  - Re-evaluating model performance with your data
